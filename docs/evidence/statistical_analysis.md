## Thematic Analysis Results

### Theme 1: Temporal Efficiency Loss (100% of participants)
**Definition**: Time spent on coordination exceeds productive study time

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Quantitative**: Average 3.2 hours/week (Range: 2.5-4.5 hours)
- **Qualitative Codes**: 
  - Scheduling conflicts (5/5 participants)
  - Communication overhead (4/5 participants)
  - Group formation time (5/5 participants)

**Representative Quotes**:
> "I spend at least 3 hours every week just trying to coordinate when everyone can meet. By the time we actually sit down to study, I'm already mentally exhausted." (I01)

> "Last week I sent 47 messages across different group chats just to schedule one 2-hour study session. The coordination took longer than the actual studying." (I03)

> "I've started studying alone because forming groups is more work than it's worth. But then I miss out on the collaborative benefits." (I05)

### Theme 2: Matching Preferences (4/5 participants prefer gradual matching)
**Definition**: Preference for algorithmic compatibility assessment over instant connections

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Gradual matching preference**: 80% (4/5)
- **Instant matching preference**: 20% (1/5)
- **Vetting period desired**: Average 2-3 interactions before commitment

**Representative Quotes**:
> "I need to vet partners before committing to a long-term study relationship. You can't just throw people together and expect it to work." (I02)

> "An algorithm that learns my study habits and gradually introduces compatible partners would be ideal. Like a dating app but for studying." (I04)

> "I want to see how someone studies before I commit my precious time to them." (I01)

### Theme 3: Privacy Concerns (5/5 participants expressed concerns)
**Definition**: Apprehension about sharing academic performance and personal data

**Supporting Evidence**:
- **Performance data sharing concern**: 100% (5/5)
- **Schedule sharing comfort**: 60% (3/5)
- **Learning style sharing comfort**: 80% (4/5)

**Representative Quotes**:
> "I'm worried about sharing my grades or test scores. What if it affects how people perceive me or if it gets back to professors?" (I04)

> "I'd share my availability and subjects I'm studying, but not my GPA or specific performance metrics." (I02)

> "Privacy is huge. I need control over what information is shared and with whom." (I03)
